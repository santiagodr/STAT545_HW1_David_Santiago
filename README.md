# STAT545 all homework assignments - SANTIAGO DAVID

Welcome to the repo of my homework for [STAT545](http://stat545.com). 
My name is **Santiago David**, and I'm a PhD student in the [Jankowski Lab](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~jankowsk/) in the department of Zoology and Biodiversity Research Centre at UBC. I'm from Colombia and I study the ecology and evolution of tropical birds... so yes! I do travel a lot to the tropics to do fieldwork and escape winter in Canada, but I love both places...

Please follow the links to specific homework!
