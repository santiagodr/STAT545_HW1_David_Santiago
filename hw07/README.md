# [HW07](http://stat545.com/hw07_automation.html) Automating DAta-analysis Pipelines

### Activities

- All coding, graphs, and materials are in this [md.file]

### Reporting process

The goal would be to get data from the internet (tentatively SACC species list by country) (http://www.museum.lsu.edu/~Remsen/SACCListByCountry.xls), run some cleaning to produce a csv file that is usable, run some stats and produce graphs. The idea would be that in some months when the list is updated, we can just run a Makefile and produce an update of everything...

First, need to decide how to extract the data, using base R, or curl???
