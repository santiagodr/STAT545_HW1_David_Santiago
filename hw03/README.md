# [HW_03](http://stat545.com/hw03_dplyr-and-more-ggplot2.html) Use dplyr to manipulate and explore data (also use ggplot2)

### Step 1 - Select three tasks (at least)
For this homework I selected the tasks

- Maximum and minimum GDP per capita for all continents
- Spread of GDP per capita within continent
- Life expectancy change over time on different continents
- Custom one and maybe interesting story

All coding, graphs and materials in this [file](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago/blob/master/hw03/dplyr_ggplot_hw03.md)

### Step 2 - Reporting process

- All this homework was done using R Studio and the usual workflow

- I tried to include observations, objectives and the specific resources I used in each of the tasks, so you will find all that in each section of the `.md` file. This assignment was more time consuming than the previous ones. I tried to learn something new for each of the tasks, such as plotting two y-axis, creating quantiles, or modifying the output of the table, but each of these things turned out to be more difficult than I expected, so I googled a lot to find a way to solve it. It seems that everything is possible in terms of creating graphs or tables, and the most challenging part for me was to decide how to visualize or what to include in the table to effectively answer the question.

- I wanted to do more!!!, but honestly this four tasks were already a huge learning step for me, hope I can explore the additional tasks during the peer-review process.
