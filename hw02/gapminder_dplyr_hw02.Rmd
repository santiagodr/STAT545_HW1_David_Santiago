We already installed the packages, so I'll just go ahead and load them
```{r}
library("gapminder")
library("tidyverse")
```

## Explore the gapminder object:

Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list?
```{r}
typeof(gapminder)
```
Answer: Gapminder is an object of the type *list*. I used the function `typeof` to ask for its type

What’s its class?
```{r}
class(gapminder)
```

How many variables/columns?
```{r}
dim(gapminder)
```

How many rows/observations?
Can you get these facts about “extent” or “size” in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts?
What data type is each variable?
