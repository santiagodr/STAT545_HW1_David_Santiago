# [HW_02](http://stat545.com/hw02_explore-gapminder-dplyr.html) Explore Gapminder and use dplyr

### Step 1 - Make a homework repo


After some struggling, At the end I have a [HW repo](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago) and folders for [hw01](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago/tree/master/hw01) and [hw02](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago/tree/master/hw02)

### Step 2 - Gapminder exploration

I did most of this homework in this Markdown [file](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago/blob/master/hw02/gapminder_dplyr_hw02.md), hopefully everything works!

### Step 3 - Report your process

- I feel most of my exploration of `ggplot` was just trying everything once and once again, sometimes the code didn't give me what I was expecting in a plot, and it was mostly because the information I was including in `aes()` and the order of each "layer" I was adding to the plot... so hopefully with time this would be more intuitive.

- I have used `dplyr` in previous exercises and in some personal *messy* data, so that was not too complicated (I mean, specifically for the basic verbs).

- I decided to rename the first repo I used for hw01 to become the only repo for all homework. I quickly discovered this will create several conflicts with the remote and local copy, so I thought an easier solution would be to reorganize all the repo with subfolders for each homework using the Github browser online. For this I followed the Github help [Moving a file to a New Location](https://help.github.com/articles/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location/). I then cloned this repo again on my local copy and started working from my computer using R Studio. 
**Note**: I'm sure there is a better "fancier" solution using Terminal for this case, but I didn't try it at this point.

- I also learned how to create tables using `knitr::kable`, basically just reading from the Markdown [help webpage](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html)

- All this homework was done using R Studio
