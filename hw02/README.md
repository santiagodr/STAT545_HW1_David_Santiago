### Step 1 - Make a homework repo

I decided to rename the first repo I used for hw01 to become the only repo for all homework. I quickly discovered this will create several conflicts with the remote and local copy, so I thought an easier solution would be to reorganize all the repo with subfolders for each homework using the Github browser online. For this I followed the Github help [Moving a file to a New Location](https://help.github.com/articles/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location/). I then cloned this repo again on my local copy and started working from my computer using R Studio. 
**Note**: I'm sure there is a better "fancier" solution using Terminal for this case, but I didn't try it at this point.

At the end I have a [HW repo](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago) and folders for [hw01](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago/tree/master/hw01) and [hw02](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago/tree/master/hw02)
