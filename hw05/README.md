# [HW05](http://stat545.com/hw05_factor-figure-boss-repo-hygiene.html) Factor and figure management; Repo hygiene

### Activities 
- Factor management
- File I/O
- Visualization design
- Writing figures to file
- Clean up your repo!

All coding, graphs, and materials are in this [md.file](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago/blob/master/hw05/factor_figure_management_hw05.md)

### Reporting process...

- All this homework was done using R Studio and the usual workflow

- I included specific objectives, a brief description of the process and a few observations for each independent activity. I used the database singer and created subsets of data as needed for each objective. Most of the requirements for this homework were clear, but the way it is described was not very fluent to me, I had to comeback frequently to the main webpage to try to understand what I needed to do, and what was the clearer way to achieve those goals. At the end, I feel I learned a lot of functions, and finally have a clear understanding of what factors mean!

### Additional resources...

For this assignment, I relied a lot in the class materials, since we didn't explore a lot of these functions in class. Specifically, I looked at:

- STAT545 [Be the boss of your factors](http://stat545.com/block029_factors.html#change-order-of-the-levels-principled) and [Taking control](http://stat545.com/block019_enforce-color-scheme.html) of qualitative colors in ggplot2
- [Top 50 ggplot](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html) visualizations and the specific reference material for [gradient color scales](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_gradient.html), and [scales for area](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_size.html)
- [viridis color palettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) after the wonderful lecture on Visualization Analysis & Design by Tamara Munzner. [slides here](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/talks/minicourse14/vad17stat545.pdf)
