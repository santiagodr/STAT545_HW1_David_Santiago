# STAT545 Homework #1
--------------------------------

Welcome to the repo of my first homework for [**STAT545**](http://stat545.com). My name is **Santiago David**, and I'm a PhD student in the [Jankowski Lab](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~jankowsk/) in the department of Zoology and Biodiversity Research Centre at UBC. I'm from Colombia and I study the ecology and evolution of tropical birds... so yes! I do travel a lot to the tropics to do fieldwork and escape winter in Canada, but I love both places...

### Reporting process...

- **README.md file** At first I just created the Repo for this homework + README.md file and did my first edits using the browser online. Then, I cloned the repo to my local copy and started using the recommended workflow *pull - edits - save - commit - push*. I also added a photo by uploading it to the repo.

- **Gapminder exploration** The homework asked to work on the same R Markdown document we started on Sept 14, but I didn't really have one specific for Gapminder, I had only an example of Rmd in general and another R script for Gapminder. So, I started a new one here for the homework using R Studio and *pull - edits - save - commit - push*. I did some basic functions to explore *gapminder*. At the end, I added the R markdown and markdown files and any associated files using R Studio.

- **Final reflections...!** This assignment was very straightforward since we explored most of this material in class. The only resource I explored was [the sample readme file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/hw01_sample_readme.md) suggested on the website, which has a lot of good tricks and examples.
I think the only confusing part was whether we were supposed to just create a repo in our own accounts, or whether there was going to be some other private personal repo for this class. This was because a line in the homework. Also, I don't think we used R markdown with gapminder on the previous week, but in general no major Problems.
