This R Markdown document is for exploration of Gapminder

First, I have to load gapminder and tidyverse
```{r warning=TRUE}
library("gapminder")
library("tidyverse")
```

I can check some of the properties of this database using basic functions such as `head` or `str`
```{r}
head(gapminder) # just to check first lines
str(gapminder) # to inspect a dataframe
summary(gapminder) # summary of everything
glimpse(gapminder) # show variables on the opposite side
```

I can also visualize the data with a basic plot, for example for two variables Life expectancy and year. In this case I modify the size of the graph as well...

```{r, fig.width= 6, fig.height= 4}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, gapminder)
```

I also wanted to visualize Life Expectancy overall, so I used a histogram
```{r, fig.width= 6, fig.height= 4}
hist(gapminder$lifeExp)
```
