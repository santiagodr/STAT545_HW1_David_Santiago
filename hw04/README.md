# [HW04](http://stat545.com/hw04_tidy-data-joins.html) Tidy data and Joins

### Choose your own adventure

- Pick one of the data reshaping prompts and do it.

I selected Activity #2 and #3 from the suggested prompts

- Pick a join prompt and do it.

I decided to try Activity #1, but with a second open access database to add information to gapminder.

All coding, graphs, references and materials are in this [md.file](https://github.com/santiagodr/STAT545_hw_David_Santiago/blob/master/hw04/tidy_data_joins_hw04.md)

### Reporting process...

- All this homework was done using R Studio and the usual workflow

- I tried to include observations, objectives and the specific resources I used in each activity. This assignment was very straigthforward since I had clear objectives from the beginning. However, the tricky part was to clean and `tidy` the data for a second database in the **joins** part of the assignment. I decided to use some real data as a second database, instead of creating a new one, but as expected, data from the internet are always messy and hard to clean. I spent a fair amount of time trying to get the data into the necessary form to be able to do joins, so I also practice more `dplyr` and `tidyr` along the way.

- I also tried the activity #3 in the first part but after thinking for a while, I dont see how the "wide" shape of the data will help us to produce a better visualization in most cases. As we know, ggplot2 prefer long format.
